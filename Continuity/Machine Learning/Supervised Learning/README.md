# Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, ***we are given the "right answer" for each example**, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

*Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems:* 

* In a **regression** problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some **continuous function** (an amount of something). 

* In a **classification** problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into **discrete categories** (a category of something).
