# What is Machine Learning?

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: 

*"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."*

**Example:** playing checkers.

* E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

* T = the task of playing checkers.

* P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
